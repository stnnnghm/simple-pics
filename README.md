# Simple-Pics - Simple Image Retrieval
This simple program retrieves an image from a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) system and streams them to a front-end, probably a browser or some other system.

`SIMPLE-PICS` uses [GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs) to store files larger than the 16MB limit imposed on documents in MongoDB, though it is actually part of MongoDB.
